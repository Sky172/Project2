<br>
<ul>
<li><h5>Latino/Latina</h5></li><br></br> In my lifre time, I've heard a lot of negative things about this group of people. As I asked around on what Latinos and Latinas thought about stereotypes this is the list I came up with.<br></br>
<ol> 
<li>Passing: Since every race has an ideal look, many hispanics are misconcepted for being caucasian because of their lighter skin tone and when they say otherwise, people claim them passing.</li>
<li>Rapists: It's simple. When people see someone of the hispanic herritage, they are deemed as a rapist.</li>
<li>Drug Dealers: it is so common that minorities are the bad guys in society which, in a lot of cases isn't true.</li>
</ol>
<li><h5>African-American</h5></li><br></br> This one hits home because I have crediability for this group but I will say that evryone has there own depection of race and how describe each one</li>
<ol>
<li>Lazy: When we claim we are tired it's deemed lazy if african americans aren't allowed to be tires and want to rest when they need too</li>
<li> Gang Bangers: It is true that there are a lot of gangs and the ones in LA are either predominately black or hispanic. However, that doesn't mean everyone is. There is also the fact that each race has their own gangs. It may not be the same as another but wrong is wrong and each race can plead guilty.<li>
<li> Only fit for the music and sports industry: Though some African-Americans work well with this industry, it's not for everybody. The only reason we donm't here about famous black scientists and politicians as much is because society doesn't want that.
</ol>
<li><h5> Caucasian</h5></li><br></br> Everyone faces racism and there shouldn't be a reason to exclude any race. From articles and videos that I have watched some of the stereotypes I've gathhered from caucasian people are
<ol>
<li> All white people are racist: That is not true. I admit to having a bias againt caucasians but it makes me upset when people just assume how someone percieves other people</li>
<li> They Can't dance: Let's be real, half of you probably can't dance. You can't justify something such as talent based on someone's skin pigmintation.</li>
</ol>
<li><h5>Asian</h5></li>
<ol>
<li>They all sound the same: False, simply false. I have heard som many people say "don't they speak ching-chang-chong". The amount of disrespect that has is fustratating. You have manderin,vietnamese, korean, Japanese, etc. because different countries have different culture</li>
<li>They are with computers: Some are, but not all of them. Like anybody else, we all have our own strengths and weaknesses. Before race, culture, language or anything people decide to genralize someone as, the first thing people should comprehend is that we are all people. Human Beings</li.
</ol>
