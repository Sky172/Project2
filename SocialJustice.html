<div class="box d"><h1>Age stereotypes</h1>
<br></br>
<p>Ageism is something that has been around for cetnuries and still finds its way into modern-day society. The term originated in 1969 defining the descrimination againtst middle-aged and elderly people. For older people, it becomes harder to find jobs and become more restricted from social services.Its not just older people though. Its younger age groups too, mainly teens and sometimes children. It's very easy to tell a child that their just imagining things or don't know what they're talking about when they actually do. They learn from adults after all. When it comes to teens, we just blame it on hormonal changes and say "they'll get over it", when it's not always that simple. I believe that everyone has a part to play no matter how old they are, however, there aren't enough people to see that and that's what needs to change in the upcoming decade.</p>

<div class="box e"><h1>Gender stereotypes</h1>
<br></br>
<P>Since we were were young, we were told that we had to act a certain way because society said so. If your a girl, you're expected to like the color pink, destined to be housewives, and told that they need a man to protect them. If your are a boy, you're not allowed to cry, you can't say " I love you" to your boys because its gay, and your not man enough if you don't know how to fight or get yourself into trouble. Everything is so cookie-cutter and a lot of people don't seem to realise that not everyone can fit into the same mold nor do a lot of people want to. According to the Adolescent Health journal, the stereotypes are world-wide and often leave a negative impact as boys and girls reach puberty all the way to adulthood. Some of these effects include:<br></br>
<ul>
<h2>Girls</h2>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>Child Marriage</li>
<li>Leaving school early</li>
<li> Exposure to violence</li>
<br></br>
<h2>Boys</h2>
<li> Becoming prone to alcohol and substance abuse</li>
<li>engaging in vigerous violence</li>
<li>Dying from unintentional injuries</li>
<li>Having shorter life expectancy than girls</li>
</ul>

<div class="box f"><h1>Racial Stereotypes<h1>
<br>
<ul>
<li><h5>Latino/Latina</h5></li><br></br> In my lifre time, I've heard a lot of negative things about this group of people. As I asked around on what Latinos and Latinas thought about stereotypes this is the list I came up with.<br></br>
<br></br>
<ol> 
<li>Passing: Since every race has an ideal look, many hispanics are misconcepted for being caucasian because of their lighter skin tone and when they say otherwise, people claim them passing.</li>
<li>Rapists: It's simple. When people see someone of the hispanic herritage, they are deemed as a rapist.</li>
<li>Drug Dealers: it is so common that minorities are the bad guys in society which, in a lot of cases isn't true.</li>
</ol>
<li><h5>African-American</h5></li><br></br> This one hits home because I have crediability for this group but I will say that evryone has there own depection of race and how describe each one</li>
<br></br>
<ol>
<li>Lazy: When we claim we are tired it's deemed lazy if african americans aren't allowed to be tires and want to rest when they need too</li>
<li> Gang Bangers: It is true that there are a lot of gangs and the ones in LA are either predominately black or hispanic. However, that doesn't mean everyone is. There is also the fact that each race has their own gangs. It may not be the same as another but wrong is wrong and each race can plead guilty.</li>
<li> Only fit for the music and sports industry: Though some African-Americans work well with this industry, it's not for everybody. The only reason we donm't here about famous black scientists and politicians as much is because society doesn't want that.</li>
</ol>
<li><h5> Caucasian</h5></li><br></br> Everyone faces racism and there shouldn't be a reason to exclude any race. From articles and videos that I have watched some of the stereotypes I've gathhered from caucasian people are
<br></br>
<ol>
<li> All white people are racist: That is not true. I admit to having a bias againt caucasians but it makes me upset when people just assume how someone percieves other people</li>
<li> They Can't dance: Let's be real, half of you probably can't dance. You can't justify something such as talent based on someone's skin pigmintation.</li>
</ol>
<li><h5>Asian</h5></li>
<br></br>
<ol>
<li>They all sound the same: False, simply false. I have heard som many people say "don't they speak ching-chang-chong". The amount of disrespect that has is fustratating. You have manderin,vietnamese, korean, Japanese, etc. because different countries have different culture</li>
<li>They are with computers: Some are, but not all of them. Like anybody else, we all have our own strengths and weaknesses. Before race, culture, language or anything people decide to genralize someone as, the first thing people should comprehend is that we are all people. Human Beings</li.
