Eventually people have to realise that we have one earth and we have to share it. Life could be easy if we chose too. My advice, ask questions, get to know them before you make ypur decision. I'm not saying walk up to a stranger and spill all your personal information. What I am saying is if your in a place were you have the opprotunity to know someone, take advantage of it. If not, just mind your business. ChANGE IS POSSIBLE!</h5></div>
